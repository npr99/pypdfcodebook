Steps to replicate:(Reference - ChatGPT)

1. Make sure you have following directory structure:
/<your package name>/
  ├── <your package name>/
  │    └── __init__.py  # <-- Your code here!
  └── pyproject.toml    # <-- Packaging config
  
2. Edit pyproject.toml 
-  Add your own Email ID and name in "authors" 
-  "name" should be unique, so avoid common names as those probably already exist as a test package. This is one of the main reasons there could be an issue in test package creation.

Snippet of the file:
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "ruchika-shukla-test-package-072720252 <- change this, I have kept this for reference. avoid common names like test_package. Keep this same as directory name you used for your root as in step 1"
version = "0.2.2"
description = "test package"
authors = [{name="add your name <- change this", email="add your mail <- change this"}]
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"

3. In cmd, go to your project root using -> cd project/root (just a sample directory, replace with project root directory):
Now run:
python -m build

4. Make a TestPyPI Account here - https://test.pypi.org/account/register/

5. Setup API Token:
Go to https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/ -> API Tokens -> Add API Token

6. Install twine using pip:
pip install --upgrade build twine (I have not tried using conda)

7. Upload package to TestPyPI using twine:
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

8. Go to https://test.pypi.org/manage/projects/ and click on your project that you uploaded. Get the installation command. 
For example, pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ruchika-shukla-test-package-07272025
Install using this command and verify post installation!

9. Smoke Test using python -c "import <your package name> as pkg; print('2 + 3 =', pkg.add_num(2, 3))"
