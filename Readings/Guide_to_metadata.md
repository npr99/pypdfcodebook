# A Guide to Metadata

## Introduction

Metadata is "data about data." It provides essential context, structure, and meaning for datasets, making them understandable and usable for others. In this project, metadata is central to documenting, sharing, and reusing complex social and housing data. This guide explains the key elements of metadata in this project, how they are organized, and why they matter.

## 1. Project Overview Metadata

The project overview provides essential context for the dataset and codebook. It includes:

- **Project Title**: The name and version of the project.
- **Principal Investigator**: Name and contact information for the lead researcher.
- **Required Citations**: Publications to cite when using the data or code.
- **Project Description**: A summary of the project's purpose, methods, and significance.
- **Funding Source**: Organizations and grants supporting the project.
- **Related Works**: Links to related projects, tools, or research centers.
- **Keywords**: Main topics and data types.
- **License**: The license under which the data/code is shared.
- **Project Identification Number**: Unique identifier and link to the data repository.

These elements orient new users, support transparency, and ensure proper use and attribution.

## 2. Data Dictionary Metadata

A data dictionary is a table that describes each variable in the dataset. It includes:

- **Variable Name**: The name of the variable as it appears in the data.
- **Data Type**: The type of data (e.g., String, Int, Float, category).
- **Length**: The length of the variable (if applicable).
- **Categorical**: Whether the variable is categorical.
- **Variable Label**: A descriptive label for the variable.

These fields are generated by the `create_data_dictionary_table` function and are essential for understanding what each variable represents and how to use it.

## 3. Variable Types and Summaries

The codebook provides detailed summaries for each variable, using the following types and associated functions:

- **String Variables** (`string_table`): Summarizes string/object variables, including total cases, valid/missing counts, unique values, minimum/maximum length, and random examples.
- **Numeric Variables** (`numeric_table`): Summarizes integer and float variables, including total/valid/missing cases, range, mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles.
- **Categorical Variables** (`categorical_toptable`, `categorical_countfreq_table`): Summarizes categorical variables, including counts, frequencies, code-label mappings, and (optionally) population totals.

Each summary includes additional metadata:
- **Unit of Measure**: The measurement unit for the variable.
- **Unit of Analysis**: The entity the variable describes (e.g., household, housing unit).
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculated for numeric and categorical variables (e.g., mean, percentiles, counts).
- **Examples**: Randomly selected values for string variables to illustrate data content.

## 4. Key Terms and Definitions

Key terms are defined in a dedicated section and file. This ensures that all users have a shared understanding of important concepts, reducing ambiguity and supporting consistent interpretation. The `add_keyterms` function reads and displays these definitions in the codebook.

---

## 5. Types of Metadata in This Project

The codebook and supporting files generate and document several types of metadata:

- **Descriptive Metadata**: Project overview, variable labels, and key terms.
- **Structural Metadata**: Data dictionary, variable types, and data structure.
- **Administrative Metadata**: Licensing, funding, and citation information.
- **Statistical Metadata**: Summary statistics for variables (mean, median, percentiles, frequencies).
- **Relational Metadata**: Links between variables (e.g., code-label mappings for categorical variables).

---

## 6. Order of Metadata Presentation

The codebook presents metadata in the following order, matching the function order in `codebook.py`:

1. **Table of Contents** (`render_toc`)
2. **Project Overview** (`add_projectoverview`)
3. **Data Dictionary** (`add_datadictionary`)
4. **Variable Details and Notes** (`add_var_summary`)
   - String, numeric, and categorical summaries
   - Category code tables and notes
5. **Key Terms and Definitions** (`add_keyterms`)

---

## Conclusion

Comprehensive metadata is essential for making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). This guide, together with the codebook, ensures that all users—now and in the future—can understand, trust, and build upon your data.
